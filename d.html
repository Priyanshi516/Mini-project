    <h1>Our Defence Power</h1>
    <p>Given the comprehensive nature of its defence assets, which span land, sea and air, India seems well positioned to meet the security challenges in a fast-changing world. What helps is that it possesses a nuclear arsenal and has developed a credible nuclear triad, allowing it to deliver nuclear weapons from land, air and sea. This strength in fundamentals also bolsters its influence in geopolitics. India’s ranking as the fourth most powerful military in the world according to the 2024 Global Firepower Index reflects its significant role in regional security. But in order to emerge as a major global power in defence, it needs to do plenty more.

        <section>For, though India is undoubtedly a regional military power, it is not classified as a ‘military superpower’ like the US, Russia and China. Experts believe that India’s aspiration to become one calls for a multifaceted approach. It involves modernising its armed forces, forging strong international alliances, enhancing training, investing in research and development, boosting cyber warfare and space capabilities, strengthening maritime power, securing economic and indu­strial support, sharpening intelligence and surveillance, integrating Artificial Intelligence and quantum computing, maintaining nuclear deterrence, even leveraging soft power and diplomacy.</section></p>
