    <h1>Our Culture Diversity</h1>
    <h2>What is Cultural Diversity?</h2>
  <p>The cultural diversity meaning is an ideological belief upheld in societies that recognize, appreciate, and respect the cultural behaviors and presence of other people or people from diversified groups. Societies comprise different types of people originating from diversified ethnic groups. Each ethnic group is constrained by its specific values, behaviors, and social norms. Therefore, a culturally diverse society enables and empowers different contributions that different people make from various ethnic backgrounds. Essentially, cultural diversity is the act of inclusiveness; that is, acknowledging people from different cultural backgrounds and creating an enabling environment that recognizes and values the social behaviors of others. Understanding diversity stands out as a critical aspect of promoting cultural diversity. In this regard, diversity is attributed to various factors such as religion, ethnicity, and race, among others.
    <section>Existence of Multiple Cultures
        The world's population comprises people from different cultures. Therefore, in a culturally diversified society, society includes people from multiple cultures, with each culture being a product of individual development. Individual development refers to the historical development of the culture, the people involved, their social behavior, and how the population merged or moved to their current society. However, even though they come from different cultural backgrounds, they acknowledge the cultural diversity of others and live together in harmony.</section>
    <section>Cultural diversity can be affected by political factors such as censorship or the protection of the rights of artists, and by economic factors such as free trade or protectionism in the market for cultural goods. Since the middle of the 20th century, there has been a concerted international effort to protect cultural diversity, involving the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and its member states. This involves action at international, national, and local levels. Cultural diversity can also be promoted by individual citizens in the ways they choose to express or experience culture.</section>
    <section>Cultural diversity is difficult to quantify. One measure of diversity is the number of identifiable cultures. The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs reports that, although their numbers are relatively small, indigenous peoples account for 5,000 distinct cultures and thus the majority of the world's cultural diversity.[11][9]

        Another aspect of cultural diversity is measured by counting the number of languages spoken in a region or in the world as a whole. By this measure, the world's cultural diversity is rapidly declining. Research carried out in the 1990s by David Crystal suggested that at that time, on average, one language was falling into disuse every two weeks. He calculated that if that rate of the language death were to continue, then by the year 2100, more than 90% of the languages currently spoken in the world will have gone extinct</section>
