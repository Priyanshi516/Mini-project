    <h1>Indian Cuisine</h1>
   <P>Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.

    Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism and Islam, cultural choices and traditions.[1][2]
    
    Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in introducing certain foods to this country. The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruits to India. A number of these such as potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, peanuts, and guava have become staples in many regions of India.[3]</P>

        <h2>Regional cuisines</h2>
        Cuisine differs across India's diverse regions as a result of variation in local culture, geographical location (proximity to sea, desert, or mountains), and economics. It also varies seasonally, depending on which fruits and vegetables are ripe. </section>
       <section> The people of early Vedic civilizations in India were nomadic pastoralists who practiced elaborate rituals to placate their gods. Agni, the god of fire, was considered the mouth through which the gods ate their sacrifices, and one of his favourite foods was ghee (clarified butter), which remains popular to this day. Animal sacrifices were common, and the meat was then consumed by those participating in the ritual. While some textual evidence suggests that these sacrifices included cattle, some argue that this claim is a result of mistranslation. (The subject of eating beef is politically contentious in present-day India.) Barley was common during the period, and there is no mention of wheat. Milk and its products, such as yogurt and barley-based milk porridges, are documented.</section>
 <section> Indian influences are also present in South Africa, most notably in bunny chow, a meat curry served in a hollowed-out loaf of Western-style bread. Tamil influences are strong in Malaysia and Singapore, where roti canai, an Indian-influenced bread, is popularly served with meat curries. Indian dishes have long been popular in the U.K.: the Norris Street Coffee House in London advertised a curry in 1773, and today chicken tikka masala is one of Britainâ€™s most popular dishes. Indian restaurants proliferate in North America as well. Most of these restaurants serve multiple cuisines from across India.</section>
