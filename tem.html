    <h1>Spirituality For Advancement</h1>
    <h2>What Is Spiritual Progress?</h2>
        <p>Spiritual progress is not a question of being able to jump through a series of hoops or meditating a certain number of hours. It is about making the effort in every moment to receive divine grace as fully as we can. The sun shines throughout the day but not everything receives its light. Sometimes the light is blocked by an object. At other times, one deliberately blocks the light with a barrier.
        Yogananda gave us a helpful formula in this regard. He said the spiritual path is 25 percent our effort, 25 percent the guruâ€™s effort, and 50 percent the grace of God. It would be worth noting that unless we do our 25 percent (which is everything we can put into it) we cannot engage the help of the guru and the grace of God that is going to be what takes us over the top.</p>

<section>Saint John made the following statement concerning Jesus and the Christ Consciousness:

As many as received Him, to them gave He the power to become the sons of God.

What we gain spiritually is in direct proportion to the energy we put forth. We cannot simply wait for it to happen; we need to pray for help, pray for progress.
<h2>How Can We Make Spiritual Progress?</h2>
BELIEVE IN YOUR ABILITY to make progress and that you are making progress, assuming that you are putting out energy spiritually.

At three different fundraising events for Ananda, I ran a full marathon. It was a very interesting internal process for me. I only trained a few times at a ten-mile run. I simply did not put out the energy to train more but counted on my almost daily five-mile runs through the hills. On my first attempt to run a marathon, I observed that at about three miles I felt with certainty that I would complete the run in full. The goal was laid out before me and all I needed to do was keep moving forward. Five and one-half hours after I began, I finished successfully. Be strong in yourself and in the thought that your effort is moving you forward.</section>
